# Predicting quality of white wine from various characteristics

# **Summary**

# **Introduction**

# **Methods**

## **Data**

The dataset that we used came from the University of
California Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository and was collected by Paulo
Cortez, University of Minho, Guimarães, Portugal and A. Cerdeira, F. Almeida,
T. Matos with help from J. Reis, Viticulture Commission of the Vinho Verde
Region(CVRVV), Porto, Portugal in 2009. The dataset contains the results of
various physiochemical tests on white "Vinho Verde" wine samples from Northern
Portugal and can be found [here]( <https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality>)
specifically with the [white wine dataset]( [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/winequality-white.csv).](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/winequality-white.csv).)
No additional features or specific branding of each wine is available in the
dataset for privacy purposes. Each row in the dataset represents a single wine
which was tested and scored based on sensory data.

## **Analysis**

A classification model was built using the random forest??? algorithm
was and allowed us to predict a sensory score based on the physiochemical testing
information recorded for each wine. Because of the privacy constraints of the
data our dataset is somewhat limited since useful potentially factors that
might influence the scoring such as grape types, brand names, or price are not available
to us. Assumptions we made regarding this dataset are that the quality scores came
from the opinions of wine critics and that testing for all wines was consistent.
The model was fit using all??? of the variables from the dataset. Hyperparameters
n\_estimators and max\_depth were optimized via random search while all other hyperparameters
used the default sklearn RandomForestRegressor() values. Some potential limitations
of this model are that \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. If provided with more time we would be
able to improve our analysis by \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

# **Results & Discussion**

To determine how useful strong of an influence each feature
has on the quality score we created a correlation plot using the altair package
which shows how each of the different features is correlated with each other.
This chart showed us that different features had varying degrees of influence on
the quality score, with increased alcohol content and decreased density most heavily
influencing the quality score. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_CONSIDER REMOVING FEATURES WITH
LITTLE INFLUENCE SUCH AS FREE SULFUR DIOXIDE AND CITRIC ACID

We found that a random forest classifier with hyperparaters n\_estimators
and max\_depth set to values of 300 and 10 respectively worked best with our
dataset. This resulted in use producing a model with a training score of 0.929264
and a testing score of 0.499623.
